```sql
-- Posts table
CREATE TABLE posts (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id),
  content TEXT NOT NULL,
  status VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'draft', -- draft, scheduled, published
  scheduled_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,

  tags TEXT[],
  score_data JSONB, -- Stores scoring results
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Post versions table for history
CREATE TABLE post_versions (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  post_id UUID REFERENCES posts(id),
  content TEXT NOT NULL,
  version_number INTEGER,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

## Cursor.com Implementation Prompts

### 1. Content Generation API
```
"Create a Next.js API route at /api/posts/generate.ts that:
1. Accepts topic, tone, and industry from request body
2. Calls OpenAI API with a structured prompt for LinkedIn post generation
3. Returns generated content with proper error handling
4. Includes rate limiting and user authentication"
```

### 2. Content Scoring System
```
"Build a comprehensive post analysis API at /api/posts/analyze.ts that:
1. Analyzes text for readability using Flesch-Kincaid formula
2. Checks grammar using a grammar checking library
3. Evaluates hook strength by analyzing first sentence patterns
4. Detects and scores call-to-action presence and quality
5. Grades formatting for mobile optimization
6. Returns detailed scoring breakdown with specific suggestions"
```

### 3. Auto-save Functionality
```
"Create an auto-save system with:
1. Debounced saving every 30 seconds
2. Version tracking in database
3. Conflict resolution for concurrent edits
4. Recovery system for unsaved changes"
```
